# ðŸ“¬ Posts

Posts is a Python library for send ðŸ“§mail easily.


## Examples

Here is the first one to send a mail which just contains text:

```python

from posts import Posts

mail = Posts('smtp.qq.com', 'your-username', 'your-passwd')

with mail() as box:
	box.text('to_address', subject='Subject', content='Content')
```

Posts does not only support Text mail, but also Html mail

```python
box.html('to_address', subject='Subject', content='Content')
```

Next, we can send a Text mail with attachments:

```python
with mail() as box:
	box.attach({'example.jpg': './example.jpg})
	box.text('to_address')
```

Finally, we can send the Html mail with image:

```python
with mail(alias='alias') as box:
	box.attach({
			'example.jpg': './example.jpg'})
	box.html(
		recipient='to_address', 
		subject='subject', 
		content='<img src="cid:example.jpg">')
``` 

Maybe you need to send mail by ssl, don't worry:

```python

with mail(ssl=True) as box:
	box.text('to_address')
```
## Chain

Just try like this:</br>
	**box.attach(\*\*kwargs).attach(\*\*kwargs).text(\*\*kwargs)**
